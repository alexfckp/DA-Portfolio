# Data Analyst Portfolio

This repository contains four end-to-end analytics projects designed to showcase core skills:
- **P1 · Data Wrangling & EDA** — cleaning, profiling, exploration, and insight synthesis
- **P2 · SQL + Analytics** — question-driven analysis with SQL (SQLite) & Python
- **P3 · Forecasting / Predictive** — simple baseline model with interpretability
- **P4 · Visualization Storytelling** — interactive narrative & static report handoff

Each project is self-contained with:
- `notebooks/` — primary Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) as the case study
- `data/` — raw and processed (keep raw immutable); add README with data source
- `reports/` — exports (images, PDFs) and a 1-page executive summary
- `src/` — re-usable Python utilities (`utils.py`) used by the notebook
- `README.md` — problem statement, dataset, KPIs, results, and next steps

> Tip: Commit as you go. Use small, atomic commits with descriptive messages.
